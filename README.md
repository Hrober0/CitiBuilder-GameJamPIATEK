## Game description
The player's goal is to build the city whilst balancing the heat levels.
<br><br>
Heat reduces the productivity and well-being of citizens living in residential areas thus enacting a heat penalty. Make sure your income and citizens' health will be well balanced!
<br><br>
- Concrete structures produce income (money) but also deadly heat
- Greenery (parks, lakes) reduce heat but does not bring any money
<br>
Overheating of cities, although simplified in this case, is a real issue - a consequence of the overabundance of concrete structures and lack of greenery.
